# E-bookmark
![pick of site](./readmepics/1.png)

E-bookmark is a project i was given to help understand how graphql works and how to refractor code to use graphql that was previously using a restAPI!
there are some things about graphql that i know can be done that i was not able to replicate, the first being updating data on the fly so users where imedately aware visualy that a book had been removed form their list.

there was a lot of struggles i had with doing this project mentally and it showed in the early stages of my work.
im glad i got to learn and use graphql more but it feels like theres so much more to do with the apolloserver infistructure that i did not utilize.
